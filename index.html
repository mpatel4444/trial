            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Matliwala Public School has been established with the objective of promoting education among one and all. I personally believe that education in its true sense is a pre-requisite in enhancing the progress of mankind.

The mission of the school is to make the students component for the modern world and at the same time shape their character righteously. Thus to ensure the dual objective, we have adopted CBSE syllabus on one hand and have introduced Islamic studies an integral part in the course of studies in our school. More ever, our students are getting an international exposure through the foreign teachers who visit our school every year.
